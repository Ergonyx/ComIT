    <h1>My Favorite YouTube Channels</h1>

    <p>Everyone learns differently.  I myself am a destructive learner, meaning I like to break things down into their individual components and then learn each of those thing intimately.  This may not work for everyone so I've decided to make a list of my favorite YouTube channels for learning development along with a short summary of their channel.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA">Traversy Media</a><br/>
    Brad Traversy is my favorite YouTube creator when it comes to coding content.  He has playlists for learning tons of languages, libraries and frameworks including, but not limited to, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Node, and more.  If you want to challenge yourself, he also has crash courses in which he explains (quickly) the basics and most common components of various languages.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q">Dev Ed</a><br/>
    Dev Ed is another great developer with all kinds of code-along tutorials and projects.  He's a fantastic resource of JavaScript knowledge, especially some of the smaller nuances associated with it, which I think makes him great for refining your JavaScript skills.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRthRrv06q1iOl86-tTKJhg">Red Stapler</a><br/>
    Red Stapler is a CSS GOD!  While a great deal of his videos focus on CSS and some amazingly inspirational demonstrations, he also has a large assortment of tutorials spanning a large variety of topics.  One drawback is the very 'to the point' style of his vidoes as he keeps them short and concise but doesn't expand on some things.  Still a fantastic resource.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Fireship</a><br/>
    Much like Traversy Media, Fireship covers a huge assortment of languages, libraries and frameworks.  He's even got a nice '100 seconds of...' series in whcih he explains certain things in a quick and concise format which is great for refreshing your brain!  Lots of tutorials on this channel as well so I highly recommend it.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w">Academind</a><br/>
    Academind is the brainchild of Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and comes a very close second to Traversy Media for me.  I find Max's teaching to be super on point and I find his explainations to be solid.  He doesn't only do web development languages but also various applications such as Git, Excel, and Amazon Web Services.</p>
