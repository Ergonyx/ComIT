    <p>Music has been a large part of my life lately as I've used it to motivate myself, direct my behavior, and remain inspired.  Being a transit user, this gives me ample opportunities to listen to music and get myself in a calm mindset before an interview, a creative flow state before brainstorming with friends, or pumped up before a workout.  LOL.  I don't work out.</p>
